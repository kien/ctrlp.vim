1. Intro                                                          *ctrlp-intro*

Full path fuzzy file, buffer, mru and tag finder with an intuitive interface.
Written in pure Vimscript for MacVim and Vim version 7.0+. Has full support for
Vim’s |regexp| as search pattern, built-in MRU files monitoring, project’s root
finder, and more.

To enable optional extensions (tag, quickfix, dir...), see |ctrlp-extensions|.

2. Options                                                      *ctrlp-options*

Below are the available options and their default values:~

                                                                *'g:ctrlp_map'*
Use this option to change the mapping to invoke |CtrlP| in |Normal| mode: >
  let g:ctrlp_map = '<c-p>'
<

                                                                *'g:ctrlp_cmd'*
Set the default opening command to use when pressing the above mapping: >
  let g:ctrlp_cmd = 'CtrlP'
<

                                                             *'g:loaded_ctrlp'*
Use this to disable the plugin completely: >
  let g:loaded_ctrlp = 1
<

                                                        *'g:ctrlp_by_filename'*
Set this to 1 to set search by filename (not full path) as the default: >
  let g:ctrlp_by_filename = 0
<

                                                      *'g:ctrlp_regexp_search'*
Set this to 1 to set |regexp| search as the default: >
  let g:ctrlp_regexp_search = 0
<

                                                *'g:ctrlp_match_window_bottom'*
Set this to 0 to show the match window at the top of the screen: >
  let g:ctrlp_match_window_bottom = 1
<

                                              *'g:ctrlp_match_window_reversed'*
Change the listing order of the matched files in the match window. The default
setting (1) is from bottom to top: >
  let g:ctrlp_match_window_reversed = 1
<

                                                         *'g:ctrlp_max_height'*
Set the maximum height of the match window: >
  let g:ctrlp_max_height = 10
<

                                                     *'g:ctrlp_jump_to_buffer'*
When opening a file, if it's already opened somewhere |CtrlP| will try to jump
to it instead of opening a new window or new tab: >
  let g:ctrlp_jump_to_buffer = 2
<
  1 - only jump to the buffer if it’s opened in the current tab.
  2 - jump tab as well if the buffer's opened in another tab.
  0 - disable this feature.

                                                  *'g:ctrlp_working_path_mode'*
When starting up the prompt, temporarily set the working directory (i.e. the
|current-directory|) to:
  1 - the parent directory of the current file.
  2 - the nearest ancestor that contains one of these directories/files:
      .git/
      .hg/
      .bzr/
      _darcs/
      root.dir
  0 - don’t manage working directory.
>
  let g:ctrlp_working_path_mode = 2
<

                                                       *'g:ctrlp_root_markers'*
Use this to set your own root markers in addition to the default ones. Your
markers will take precedence: >
  let g:ctrlp_root_markers = ['']
<
These markers (builtins and yours) will serve as identifiers for the '/' and
'\' special inputs (section 5.e)

                                                        *'g:ctrlp_use_caching'*
Set this to 0 to disable per-session caching. When disabled, caching will still
be enabled for directories that have more than 4000 files: >
  let g:ctrlp_use_caching = 1
<
Note: you can quickly purge the cache by pressing <F5> while inside |CtrlP|.

                                                *'g:ctrlp_clear_cache_on_exit'*
Set this to 0 to enable cross-sessions caching by not clearing the cache files
upon exiting Vim: >
  let g:ctrlp_clear_cache_on_exit = 1
<

                                                          *'g:ctrlp_cache_dir'*
Set the directory to store the cache files: >
  let g:ctrlp_cache_dir = $HOME.'/.cache/ctrlp'
<

                                                    *'g:ctrlp_prompt_mappings'*
Use this to customize the mappings inside |CtrlP|’s prompt to your liking. You
only need to keep the lines that you’ve changed the values (inside []): >
  let g:ctrlp_prompt_mappings = {
    \ 'PrtBS()':              ['<bs>', '<c-]>'],
    \ 'PrtDelete()':          ['<del>'],
    \ 'PrtDeleteWord()':      ['<c-w>'],
    \ 'PrtClear()':           ['<c-u>'],
    \ 'PrtSelectMove("j")':   ['<c-j>', '<down>'],
    \ 'PrtSelectMove("k")':   ['<c-k>', '<up>'],
    \ 'PrtHistory(-1)':       ['<c-n>'],
    \ 'PrtHistory(1)':        ['<c-p>'],
    \ 'AcceptSelection("e")': ['<cr>', '<c-m>', '<2-LeftMouse>'],
    \ 'AcceptSelection("h")': ['<c-x>', '<c-cr>', '<c-s>'],
    \ 'AcceptSelection("t")': ['<c-t>', '<MiddleMouse>'],
    \ 'AcceptSelection("v")': ['<c-v>', '<RightMouse>'],
    \ 'ToggleFocus()':        ['<s-tab>'],
    \ 'ToggleRegex()':        ['<c-r>'],
    \ 'ToggleByFname()':      ['<c-d>'],
    \ 'ToggleType(1)':        ['<c-f>', '<c-up>'],
    \ 'ToggleType(-1)':       ['<c-b>', '<c-down>'],
    \ 'PrtExpandDir()':       ['<tab>', '<c-i>'],
    \ 'PrtInsert("w")':       ['<F2>'],
    \ 'PrtInsert("s")':       ['<F3>'],
    \ 'PrtInsert("v")':       ['<F4>'],
    \ 'PrtInsert("+")':       ['<F6>'],
    \ 'PrtCurStart()':        ['<c-a>'],
    \ 'PrtCurEnd()':          ['<c-e>'],
    \ 'PrtCurLeft()':         ['<c-h>', '<left>', '<c-^>'],
    \ 'PrtCurRight()':        ['<c-l>', '<right>'],
    \ 'PrtClearCache()':      ['<F5>'],
    \ 'PrtDeleteMRU()':       ['<F7>'],
    \ 'CreateNewFile()':      ['<c-y>'],
    \ 'MarkToOpen()':         ['<c-z>'],
    \ 'OpenMulti()':          ['<c-o>'],
    \ 'PrtExit()':            ['<esc>', '<c-c>', '<c-g>'],
    \ }
<
Note: In some terminals, it’s not possible to remap <c-h> without also changing
<bs>. So if pressing <bs> moves the cursor to the left instead of deleting a
char for you, add this to your |vimrc| to change the default <c-h> mapping: >
  let g:ctrlp_prompt_mappings = {
    \ 'PrtBS()':      ['<bs>', '<c-]>', '<c-h>'],
    \ 'PrtCurLeft()': ['<left>', '<c-^>'],
    \ }
<

                                                           *'g:ctrlp_mruf_max'*
Specify the number of recently opened files you want |CtrlP| to remember: >
  let g:ctrlp_mruf_max = 250
<

                                                       *'g:ctrlp_mruf_exclude'*
Files you don’t want |CtrlP| to remember. Use |regexp| to specify the patterns:
>
  let g:ctrlp_mruf_exclude = ''
<
Examples: >
  let g:ctrlp_mruf_exclude = '/tmp/.*\|/temp/.*' " MacOSX/Linux
  let g:ctrlp_mruf_exclude = '^C:\\dev\\tmp\\.*' " Windows
<

                                                       *'g:ctrlp_mruf_include'*
And if you want |CtrlP| to only remember some files, specify them here: >
  let g:ctrlp_mruf_include = ''
<
Example: >
  let g:ctrlp_mruf_include = '\.py$\|\.rb$'
<

                                                      *'g:ctrlp_mruf_relative'*
Set this to 1 to show only MRU files in the current working directory: >
  let g:ctrlp_mruf_relative = 0
<

                                                *'g:ctrlp_mruf_case_sensitive'*
Match this with your file system case-sensitivity setting to avoid duplicate
MRU entries: >
  let g:ctrlp_mruf_case_sensitive = 1
<

                                                  *'g:ctrlp_mruf_last_entered'*
Set to 1 to sort the MRU file list to most-recently-entered-buffer order: >
  let g:ctrlp_mruf_last_entered = 0
<

                                                           *'g:ctrlp_dotfiles'*
Set this to 0 if you don’t want |CtrlP| to search for dotfiles and dotdirs: >
  let g:ctrlp_dotfiles = 1
<
You can use |'wildignore'| to exclude anything from the search.
e.g. exclude version control directories: >
  set wildignore+=*/.git/*,*/.hg/*,*/.svn/*  " Linux/MacOSX
  set wildignore+=.git\*,.hg\*,.svn\*        " Windows
<
Note #1: the `*/` in front of each directory glob is required.

Note #2: |wildignore| influences the result of |expand()|, |globpath()| and
|glob()| which many plugins use to find stuff on the system (e.g. fugitive.vim
looks for .git/, some other plugins look for external exe tools on Windows).
So be a little mindful of what you put in your |wildignore|.

                                                      *'g:ctrlp_custom_ignore'*
In addition to |'wildignore'|, use this for files and directories you want only
|CtrlP| to not show. Use |regexp| to specify the patterns: >
  let g:ctrlp_custom_ignore = ''
<
Examples: >
  let g:ctrlp_custom_ignore = '\.git$\|\.hg$\|\.svn$'
  let g:ctrlp_custom_ignore = {
    \ 'dir':  '\.git$\|\.hg$\|\.svn$',
    \ 'file': '\.exe$\|\.so$\|\.dll$',
    \ 'link': 'some$\|bad$\|symbolic$\|links$',
    \ }
<

                                                    *'g:ctrlp_highlight_match'*
Use this to enable/disable highlighting of the matched patterns and to specify
the highlight group that’ll be used: >
  let g:ctrlp_highlight_match = [1, 'Identifier']
<

                                                          *'g:ctrlp_max_files'*
The maximum number of files to scan, set to 0 for no limit: >
  let g:ctrlp_max_files = 20000
<

                                                          *'g:ctrlp_max_depth'*
The maximum depth of a directory tree to recurse into: >
  let g:ctrlp_max_depth = 40
<
Note: the larger these values, the more memory Vim uses.

                                                       *'g:ctrlp_user_command'*
Specify an external tool to use for listing files instead of Vim’s globpath().
Use %s in place of the target directory: >
  let g:ctrlp_user_command = ''
<
Examples: >
  let g:ctrlp_user_command = 'find %s -type f'       " MacOSX/Linux
  let g:ctrlp_user_command = 'dir %s /-n /b /s /a-d' " Windows
<
You can also use 'grep', 'findstr' or something else to filter the results.
Examples: >
  let g:ctrlp_user_command = 'find %s -type f | grep (?!tmp/.*)'
  let g:ctrlp_user_command = 'dir %s /-n /b /s /a-d | findstr .*\.py$'
<
Use a version control listing command when inside a repository, this is faster
when scanning large projects: >
  let g:ctrlp_user_command = [repo_marker, vcs_ls_command, fallback_command]
<
If the fallback_command is empty or not defined, |globpath()| will then be used
when searching outside a repo.
Examples: >
  let g:ctrlp_user_command = ['.git/', 'cd %s && git ls-files']
  let g:ctrlp_user_command = ['.hg/', 'hg --cwd %s locate -I .']
<

                                                        *'g:ctrlp_max_history'*
The maximum number of input strings you want |CtrlP| to remember. The default
value mirrors Vim’s global |'history'| option: >
  let g:ctrlp_max_history = &history
<
Set to 0 to disable prompt’s history. Browse the history with <c-n> and <c-p>.

                                                      *'g:ctrlp_open_new_file'*
Use this option to specify how the newly created file is to be opened when
pressing <c-y>:
  t - in a new tab
  h - in a new horizontal split
  v - in a new vertical split
  r - in the current window
>
  let g:ctrlp_open_new_file = 'v'
<

                                                         *'g:ctrlp_open_multi'*
If non-zero, this will enable opening multiple files with <c-z> and <c-o>: >
  let g:ctrlp_open_multi = '1v'
<
For the number:
  - If bigger than 1, it’ll be used as the maximum number of windows or tabs to
    create when opening the files (the rest will be hidden buffers).
  - If is 1, <c-o> will open all files, each in a new window or new tab.
  - If no number is given, only the first file will be opened in a window,
    either new window or reused, and the rest will be hidden buffers.
For the letters:
  t - each in a new tab
  h - each in a new horizontal split
  v - each in a new vertical split
  Reuse the current window:
  tr,
  hr,
  vr - open the first file in the current window, then the remaining files in
       new splits or new tabs just like with t, h, v.

                                                            *'g:ctrlp_arg_map'*
When this is set to 1, the <c-o> and <c-y> mappings will accept one extra key
as an argument to override their default behavior: >
  let g:ctrlp_arg_map = 0
<
Pressing <c-o> or <c-y> will then prompt for a keypress. The key can be:
  t - open in tab(s)
  h - open in horizontal split(s)
  v - open in vertical split(s)
  r - open in current window (for <c-y> only)
  <esc>, <c-c> - cancel and go back to |CtrlP|
  Any other key - use the behavior specified with |g:ctrlp_open_new_file| and
  |g:ctrlp_open_multi|.

                                                         *'g:ctrlp_dont_split'*
When opening a file with <cr>, |CtrlP| avoids opening it in windows created by
plugins, help and quickfix. Use this to setup some exceptions: >
  let g:ctrlp_dont_split = 'netrw'
<
Acceptable values are partial names or filetypes of the special buffers. Use
|regexp| to specify the pattern. Example: >
  let g:ctrlp_dont_split = 'netrw\|help\|quickfix'
<

                                                    *'g:ctrlp_follow_symlinks'*
Set this to 1 to follow symbolic links when listing files: >
  let g:ctrlp_follow_symlinks = 0
<

                                                        *'g:ctrlp_lazy_update'*
Set this to 1 to enable the lazy-update feature: only update the match window
after typing’s been stopped for a certain amount of time: >
  let g:ctrlp_lazy_update = 0
<
If is 1, update after 250ms. If bigger than 1, the number will be used as the
delay time in milliseconds.

                                                         *'g:ctrlp_use_migemo'*
Set this to 1 to use Migemo Pattern for Japanese filenames. Migemo Search only
works in |regexp| mode. To split the pattern, separate words with space: >
  let g:ctrlp_use_migemo = 0
<

                                                        *'g:ctrlp_status_func'*
Use this to customize the statuslines for the |CtrlP| window: >
  let g:ctrlp_status_func = {}
<
Example: >
  let g:ctrlp_status_func = {
    \ 'main': 'Function_Name_1',
    \ 'prog': 'Function_Name_2',
    \ }
<

===============================================================================
5. Input Formats                                          *ctrlp-input-formats*

Formats for inputting in the prompt:~

a)  Simple string.
    e.g. 'abc' is understood internally as 'a[^a]\{-}b[^b]\{-}c'

b)  Vim |regexp|. If the input string contains '*' or '|', it’ll be treated as
    a Vim’s |regexp| |pattern| without any modification.
    e.g. 'abc\d*efg' will be read as 'abc\d*efg'.

    See also |ctrlp-fullregexp| (keymap) and |g:ctrlp_regexp_search| (option).

c)  End the string with a colon ':' followed by a Vim command to execute that
    command after opening the file. If you need to use ':' literally, escape it
    with a backslash: '\:'. When opening multiple files, the command will be
    executed on each opening file.
    e.g. 'abc:45' will open the selected file and jump to line 45.
         'abc:/my\:string' will open the selected file and jump to the first
         instance of 'my:function'.
         'abc:+setf\ myfiletype|50' will open the selected file and set its
         filetype to 'myfiletype', then jump to line 50.
         'abc:diffthis' will open the selected file and run |:diffthis| on the
         first 4 files.

    See also Vim’s |++opt| and |+cmd|.

d)  Type exactly two dots '..' at the start of the prompt and press enter to go
    backward in the directory tree by 1 level. If the parent directory is
    large, this might be slow.

e)  Similarly, submit '/' or '\' to find and go to the project’s root. If the
    project is large, using a VCS listing command to look for files might help
    speeding up the intial scan (see |g:ctrlp_user_command| for more details).

f)  Type the name of a non-existent file and press <c-y> to create it. Mark a
    file with <c-z> to create the new file in the same directory as the marked
    file.
    e.g. 'parentdir/newfile.txt' will create a directory named 'parentdir' as
         well as 'newfile.txt'.
         If 'some/old/dirs/oldfile.txt' is marked with <c-z>, then 'parentdir'
         and 'newfile.txt' will be created in 'some/old/dirs'. The final path
         will then be 'some/old/dirs/parentdir/newfile.txt'.
         Use '\' in place of '/' on Windows (if |'ssl'| is not set).

g)  Submit ? to open this help file.

===============================================================================
6. Extensions                                              *g:ctrlp-extensions*

Extensions are optional. To enable an extension, add its name to the variable
g:ctrlp_extensions: >
  let g:ctrlp_extensions = ['tag', 'buffertag', 'quickfix', 'dir', 'rtscript']
<
The order of the items will be the order they appear on the statusline and when
using <c-f>, <c-b>.

      + <c-t> change the global working directory (exit).
      + <c-v> change the local working directory for the current window (exit).
      + <c-x> change the global working directory to |CtrlP|’s current local
        working directory (exit).

                                                                    *:CtrlPRTS*

Match this with your OS’s encoding (not Vim’s). The default value mirrors Vim’s
global |'encoding'| option: >
  let g:ctrlp_buftag_systemenc = &encoding
<

                                                       *'g:ctrlp_buftag_types'*

EXTENDING                                                     *ctrlp-extending*

Extending |CtrlP| is very simple. Simply create a vim file following a short
guidelines, place it in autoload/ctrlp/ and add its name to your .vimrc.

To see how it works, get the sample.vim from the extensions branch on the main
git repository (https://github.com/kien/ctrlp.vim/tree/extensions), and place
it along with the parent directories somewhere in your runtimepath. Then put
this into your .vimrc: >
  let g:ctrlp_extensions = ['sample']
<
A new search type will show up the next time you open |CtrlP|.

For more details, check out the comments inside sample.vim.~

CREDITS                                                         *ctrlp-credits*

Developed by Kien Nguyen <github.com/kien>, initially based on the Command-T
and the LustyExplorer plugins. No code was taken from these plugins, but I did
clone the majority of their (awesome) interfaces and the way they work.

This was originally written as a module for a would-be larger plugin called
AutoDoc.vim which I’ve stopped developing because of lost of interest. I really
liked the way Command-T and LustyExplorer deal with user’s input, so I wrote a
pure Vimscript version of their prompt window, intended to use it for the
aforementioned plugin.
