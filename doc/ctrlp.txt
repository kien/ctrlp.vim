      _darcs/
      root.dir
      .vimprojects
  0 - don’t manage working directory.
>
  let g:ctrlp_working_path_mode = 1
<
You can use this functionality outside of |CtrlP| by adding the following line
to your |.vimrc|; the parameter is the same (1, 2 and 0): >
  au BufEnter * cal ctrlp#SetWorkingPath(2)
<

                                                       *'g:ctrlp_root_markers'*
Use this to set your own root markers for the |SetWorkingPath()| function, in
addition to the default ones, your markers will take precedence: >
  let g:ctrlp_root_markers = ['']
<

                                                        *'g:ctrlp_use_caching'*
Set this to 0 to disable per-session caching. When disabled, caching will still
be enabled for directories that have more than 4000 files: >
  let g:ctrlp_use_caching = 1
<
Note: you can quickly purge the cache by pressing <F5>.

                                                *'g:ctrlp_clear_cache_on_exit'*

<

                                                    *'g:ctrlp_prompt_mappings'*
Use this to customize the mappings inside |CtrlP|’s prompt to your liking. You
only need to keep the lines that you’ve changed the values (inside []): >
  let g:ctrlp_prompt_mappings = {
    \ 'PrtBS()':              ['<bs>'],
    \ 'PrtDelete()':          ['<del>'],
    \ 'PrtDeleteWord()':      ['<c-w>'],
    \ 'PrtClear()':           ['<c-u>'],
    \ 'PrtSelectMove("j")':   ['<c-j>', '<down>'],
    \ 'PrtSelectMove("k")':   ['<c-k>', '<up>'],
    \ 'PrtHistory(-1)':       ['<c-n>'],
    \ 'PrtHistory(1)':        ['<c-p>'],
    \ 'AcceptSelection("e")': ['<cr>'],
    \ 'AcceptSelection("h")': ['<c-x>', '<c-cr>', '<c-s>'],
    \ 'AcceptSelection("t")': ['<c-t>'],

    \ 'ToggleType(-1)':       ['<c-b>', '<c-down>'],
    \ 'PrtCurStart()':        ['<c-a>'],
    \ 'PrtCurEnd()':          ['<c-e>'],
    \ 'PrtCurLeft()':         ['<c-h>', '<left>'],
    \ 'PrtCurRight()':        ['<c-l>', '<right>'],
    \ 'PrtClearCache()':      ['<F5>'],
    \ 'CreateNewFile()':      ['<c-y>'],

    \ }
<

                                                          *'g:ctrlp_mru_files'*
Set this to 0 to completely disable the Most Recently Used files feature: >
  let g:ctrlp_mru_files = 1
<

                                                           *'g:ctrlp_mruf_max'*
Specify the number of recently opened files you want |CtrlP| to remember: >
  let g:ctrlp_mruf_max = 150
<

                                                       *'g:ctrlp_mruf_exclude'*
Files you don’t want |CtrlP| to remember; use |regexp| to specify the patterns:
>
  let g:ctrlp_mruf_exclude = ''
<
Examples: >
  let g:ctrlp_mruf_exclude = '/tmp/.*\|/temp/.*' " MacOSX/Linux
  let g:ctrlp_mruf_exclude = '^C:\\dev\\tmp\\.*' " Windows
<

                                                       *'g:ctrlp_mruf_include'*
And if you want |CtrlP| to only remember some files, specify them here: >
  let g:ctrlp_mruf_include = ''
<
Example: >
  let g:ctrlp_mruf_include = '\.py$\|\.rb$'
<

                                                           *'g:ctrlp_dotfiles'*
Set this to 0 if you don’t want |CtrlP| to search for dotfiles and dotdirs: >
  let g:ctrlp_dotfiles = 1
<
You can also use |'wildignore'| to exclude anything from the search.
e.g. exclude version control directories from the results: >
  set wildignore+=*/.git/*,*/.hg/*,*/.svn/*  " Linux/MacOSX
  set wildignore+=.git\*,.hg\*,.svn\*        " Windows
<
Note: the `*/` in front of each dotfile glob is required for the dotfiles
search feature to work correctly along side with |wildignore|. If you’ve
disabled dotfiles search (set |g:ctrlp_dotfiles| to 0), then you can ignore
this.

                                                    *'g:ctrlp_highlight_match'*
Use this to enable/disable highlighting of the matched patterns and to specify
the highlight group that’ll be used: >
  let g:ctrlp_highlight_match = [1, 'Identifier']
<

                                                          *'g:ctrlp_max_files'*
The maximum number of files to scan, set to 0 for no limit: >
  let g:ctrlp_max_files = 20000
<

                                                          *'g:ctrlp_max_depth'*
The maximum depth of a directory tree to recurse into: >
  let g:ctrlp_max_depth = 40
<
Note: the larger the value, the more memory Vim uses.

                                                       *'g:ctrlp_user_command'*
Specify an external tool to use for indexing files instead of Vim’s globpath().
Use %s in place of the target directory: >
  let g:ctrlp_user_command = ''
<
Examples: >
  let g:ctrlp_user_command = 'find %s -type f'       " MacOSX/Linux
  let g:ctrlp_user_command = 'dir %s /-n /b /s /a-d' " Windows
<
You can also use 'grep', 'findstr' or something else to filter the results.
Examples: >
  let g:ctrlp_user_command = 'find %s -type f | grep (?!tmp/.*)'
  let g:ctrlp_user_command = 'dir %s /-n /b /s /a-d | findstr .*\.py$'
<

                                                      *'g:ctrlp_open_new_file'*
Use this option to specify how the newly created file is to be opened when
pressing <c-y>:
  1 - in a new tab
  2 - in a new horizontal split
  3 - in a new vertical split
  0 - in the current window/split
>
  let g:ctrlp_open_new_file = 3
<

                                                        *'g:ctrlp_max_history'*
The maximum number of input strings you want |CtrlP| to remember. The default
value mirrors Vim’s global |'history'| option. E.g. `set history=50`: >
  let g:ctrlp_max_history = &history
<
Set to 0 to disable prompt’s history.

                                                         *'g:ctrlp_open_multi'*
If non-zero this will enable opening multiple files with <c-z> and <c-o>: >
  let g:ctrlp_open_multi = 0
<
If bigger than 1, it’ll be used as the maximum number of windows to create when
opening the files (the rest will be hidden buffers). If is 1, it’ll open all
files, each in a vertical split.

5. Input Formats                                          *ctrlp-input-formats*

                                                   *ctrlp-prompt-input-formats*
Formats for inputting in the prompt:

a)  Simple string. e.g. 'abc' is understood internally as 'a[^a]\{-}b[^b]\{-}c'

b)  Vim |regexp|. If the input string contains '*' or '|', it’ll be treated as
    a Vim’s |regexp| |pattern| without any modification.
    e.g. 'abc\d*efg' will be read as 'abc\d*efg'.

    See also |ctrlp-fullregexp| and |g:ctrlp_regexp_search|.

c)  End the string with a colon ':' followed by a Vim command to execute that
    command after opening the file. If you need to use ':' in the command,
    escape it with a backslash: '\:'.
    e.g. 'abc:45' will open the selected file and jump to line 45.
         'abc:/my\:function' will open the selected file and jump to the first
         instance of 'my:function'.
         'abc:+setf\ myfiletype|50' will open the selected file and set its
         filetype to 'myfiletype' then jump to line 50.

         See also |++opt| and |+cmd|.

d)  Type exactly two dots (..) at the start of the line and press enter to go
    backward in the directory tree by 1 level. If the parent directory is
    large, this might be slow.

e)  Type the name of a non-existed file and press <c-y> to create it.
    e.g. 'parentdir/file.txt' will create a directory named 'parentdir' as well
    as 'file.txt'. Use '\' in place of '/' on Windows (if |'ssl'| is not set).

Developed by Kien Nguyen (github.com/kien), based on the Command-T and the
LustyExplorer plugins. No code was taken from these plugins, but I did clone
the majority of their (awesome) interfaces and the way they work.

This was originally written as a module for a would-be larger plugin called
AutoDoc.vim which I’ve stopped developing because of lost of interest. I really
liked the way Command-T and LustyExplorer deal with user’s input, so I wrote a
pure Vimscript version of their prompt window, intended to use it for the
aforementioned plugin.
